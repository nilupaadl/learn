    "\n",
    "As a fun little example, we'll use a public data set of how US congressmen voted on 17 different issues in the year 1984. Let's see if we can figure out their political party based on their votes alone, using a deep neural network!\n",
    "\n",
    "For those outside the United States, our two main political parties are \"Democrat\" and \"Republican.\" In modern times they represent progressive and conservative ideologies, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Politics in 1984 weren't quite as polarized as they are today, but you should still be able to get over 90% accuracy without much trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the point of this exercise is implementing neural networks in Keras, I'll help you to load and prepare the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the raw CSV file using Pandas, and make a DataFrame out of it with nice column labels:"
